title: Data and Not Enough Dogs
---

Kicking off Data & Not Enough Dogs with an easy one. Here's a [link to the blog post](https://medium.com/@matthew.barnes16/dont-miss-a-step-predicting-late-consumer-behavior-19cd657939e3) I produced during my [Insight Data Science Fellowship](https://www.insightdatascience.com/). 

At some point, I plan to write a post about my experience at Insight, especially as a social scientist (and as a social scientist in the data science world more generally). But that's not today. I'll leave a dog as a parting gift.
